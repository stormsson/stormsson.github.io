NFT are probably one of the hardest, and weirdest, concepts to grasp.
Nowadays the most popular concept related to NFT is "art": we see hundreds of graphical NFTs and other kind of artworks sold on the market.

Today ownership and certification always needs someone whose purpose is to verify the authenticity of the ownership claim.
If you own a Netflix account, Netflix certitifies it and, based on this, allows you access to its features.
Your bank account is certified by your bank: you can claim you have a certain amount of money because the bank backs your statement.
